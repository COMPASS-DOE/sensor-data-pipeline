General information
—----------------------------------
Level 2 (L2) data consist of sensor observations from the COMPASS-FME
synoptic sites, TEMPEST, and DELUGE. Compared to the L1 data, these are
more consistent (always 15-minute timestamps for the entire year);
better QA/QC’d (out of bounds, out of service, and extreme outlier
values are removed); and more complete, with a gap-filled time series
available alongside the main observations, and additional derived
(calculated) variables. L2 data are intended to be rapidly and easily
usable in analyses and simulations.

Outlier and QA/QC processing:
—---------------------------------- 
Mean absolute deviation (MAD) is used to identify outliers after first
grouping data by time period; this information, and the maximum-length
gaps filled by linear interpolation is given in this table:
