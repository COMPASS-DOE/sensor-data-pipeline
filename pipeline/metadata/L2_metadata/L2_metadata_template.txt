COMPASS-FME Level 2 sensor data site documentation

General information
—----------------------------------
Level 2 (L2) data consist of sensor observations from the COMPASS-FME
synoptic sites, TEMPEST, and DELUGE. Compared to the L1 data, these are
more consistent (always 15-minute timestamps for the entire year);
better QA/QC’d (out of bounds, out of service, and extreme outlier
values are removed); and more complete, with a gap-filled time series
available alongside the main observations, and additional derived
(calculated) variables. L2 data are intended to be rapidly and easily
usable in analyses and simulations.

Derived variables 
—---------------------------------- 
Level 2 data include _derived_ variables ("DRV" above) that are not
directly measured but calculated from other variables, and perhaps
external data.

`soil-salinity-Xcm`: Soil water salinity at X cm below the surface. This
is calculated from TEROS variables VWC, T, and EC, following Hilhorst
(2000).

`gw-wl-below-surface`: Groundwater level measured in meters relative to
the ground surface, where negative values indicate water levels below
the ground surface and positive values indicate water levels above the
ground surface. This is calculated based on pressure and water density
measurements made by AquaTroll sensors, as well as well dimensions
measured during sensor deployment.

Linear interpolation
—----------------------------------
*Short* gaps in the time series are filled by linear interpolation;
this is a separate step that the mean-annual-cycle gap-filling step.
This table gives the maximum gaps filled by this interpolation.
