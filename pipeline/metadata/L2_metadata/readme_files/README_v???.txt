DESCRIPTION
—----------------------------------
Level 2 (L2) data consist of sensor observations from the COMPASS-FME
synoptic sites, TEMPEST, and DELUGE. Compared to the L1 data, these are
more consistent (always 15-minute timestamps for the entire year);
better QA/QC’d (out of bounds, out of service, and extreme outlier
values are removed); and more complete, with a gap-filled time series
available alongside the main observations, and additional derived
(calculated) variables.
